/**
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.editor.control.actions.model.AddScene} is a simple action
 * that adds a scene to the current game. It just creates a blank scene, with a
 * generated new id (e.g. "scene0"), and puts it to the scenes map.
 * 
 * The scene created has a blank
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.schema.editor.components.Note} and its
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.schema.editor.components.Note#title} is set with the
 * generated id (e.g. "scene0").
 * 
 * It adjusts the
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.schema.editor.components.EditState#editScene} field, to
 * make this scene appear on the edition view,
 * 
 * It also updates the
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.schema.editor.components.EditState#sceneorder} array,
 * adding the new scene id to the end.
 * 
 * NOTE: This action does not save the scene file to disk. The actual scene file
 * will not be created until the user saves the game.
 * 
 * Arguments and usage This action does not require any argument. However, an
 * optional boolean argument can be passed to indicate whether the operation is
 * undoable or not. This is intended for other actions that may want to invoke
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.editor.control.actions.model.AddScene} but which do not
 * want the operation to be undoable since it was not triggered by user
 * interaction. For example, this is the case of
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.editor.control.actions.editor.NewGame}, which creates a
 * blank scene in the recently created game. This operation cannot be undone
 * since it does not make sense to revert the creation of new projects.
 * 
 * This way, there are two recommended usage scenarios for this action: 1)
 * controller.action(AddScene.class) This is the way that views should be using
 * this action to create new scenes. The operation will be undoable 2)
 * controller.action(AddScene.class, false) This is the way that not-undoable
 * actions should be creating new
 * {@link es.eucm.ead.editor.control.actions.model.AddScene} actions. It
 * indicates that the add scene operation cannot be undone, since the former
 * action cannot be undone.
